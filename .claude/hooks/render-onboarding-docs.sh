## In Scope

- Initial system capability set required for first functional release
- Core interface contracts and protocol definitions

## Out Of Scope

- Advanced observability tooling beyond baseline
- Non-critical performance tuning before core path is validated

## Constraints

- ${constraints}

## Compatibility And Operability Constraints

- backward compatibility requirements to be confirmed before each interface change
- operability baseline (logs, metrics, health checks) required before release

# Architecture

## System Boundary

- Selected stack: ${selected_stack}
- Scope of this system and what it does not own

## Major Components

- (to be defined per component responsibility)

## Interface And Protocol Contract

- Public or internal interfaces to be versioned and documented
- Protocol stability requirements to be confirmed before implementation

## Runtime Topology

- Deployment model and component interaction at runtime

## Observability Baseline

- Structured logs
- Key metrics
- Health check endpoints

## Failure Mode And Recovery Assumptions

- Expected failure scenarios and recovery strategies
- Graceful degradation assumptions

## Baseline

- Selected stack: ${selected_stack}
- System style: modular service + clear boundaries between API, domain, and persistence

## Initial Components

- API layer

# Roadmap

## Workstream 1

- Goal: define component boundaries, responsibilities, and interface contracts
- Deliverables: system boundary document, interface/protocol definitions, component skeleton
- Exit Criteria: all interfaces are documented and implementation can begin without open contract blockers

## Workstream 2

- Goal: implement the core system path end-to-end on the selected stack
- Deliverables: primary data/control flow, inter-component wiring, integration baseline
- Exit Criteria: core system path is functional and basic contract tests pass

## Workstream 3

- Goal: harden operability, compatibility, and failure resilience
- Deliverables: observability baseline, backward compatibility checks, failure-mode test coverage
- Exit Criteria: operability gates pass and the system is ready for production readiness validation

# Execution Plan

## Global Plan

- Define all interface contracts before implementation starts (contract-first)
- Execute workstreams sequentially in roadmap order
- Validate backward compatibility before each interface change
- Run requirement QA after implementation and register remediation workstreams if needed
- Re-run plan only when system boundary or interface contract decisions change

## Workstream 1 Plan

- Define system boundary and component responsibilities
- Document interface and protocol contracts that downstream components depend on
- Create the minimum skeleton required to validate contracts are implementable

## Workstream 2 Plan

- Implement the core system path end-to-end
- Wire inter-component interfaces according to contracts defined in Workstream 1
- Add contract tests and failure-path tests for the critical flow

## Workstream 3 Plan

- Add observability baseline (logs, metrics, health checks)
- Validate backward compatibility and rollback assumptions
- Test failure scenarios and recovery paths
- Close operability and security gaps before release validation
